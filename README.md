- 👋 Hi, I’m @timmychin-code
- 👀 I’m interested in coding when I'm at indoors, but I love to swim, jog, play badminton and hike when I'm at outdoors
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to scrap websites and send notifications to myself when something happens in the website
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm new here :)
- 📫 How to reach me: IG: timmy_chin_
